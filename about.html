          <p><strong>Who we help</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>We help businesses looking to implement low-code/no-code software to solve their business problems. Our clients are companies at the growth stage who have some operations in place and are seeking to either improve their existing software, create a second version, or transform their services into software solutions. They recognize the potential of low-code/no-code tools but need guidance on the steps to take next.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>What we do</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>We provide a transformation service to help companies rapidly adopt and leverage low-code/no-code technologies. Our unique approach involves short, focused engagements we call &quot;turns&quot; - a period of co-creation followed by a day of implementation. This allows clients to see tangible progress and value within days. Our goal is to empower clients to take ownership of their low-code solutions. We also provide boilerplate applications that serve as a starting point, accelerating the development process even further.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>Our philosophy</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>We believe in the power of low-code/no-code tools to democratize software development and enable businesses to rapidly evolve. By providing a guided journey, training, co-creation, and foundational boilerplates, we aim to maximize the speed of development while ensuring clients gain the skills to manage their solutions long-term. We are dedicated to our clients&#x27; success and delivering high-value work in short timeframes.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>Our story</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Part 1. The Opportunity</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>I (Robert) felt there was more potential for low-code/no-code tools to accelerate digital transformation for businesses. With the right approach, companies can build and evolve software solutions at unprecedented speeds, without the typical pitfalls of traditional development.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>Part 2. Helping Clients</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>As I began working with clients to implement and debug their low-code solutions, I encountered the common challenges they faced - lengthy development cycles, misaligned goals, and a disconnect between business and technical teams. This inspired me to develop boilerplates of both front-end and back-end systems to streamline the development processes when using these tools, bringing their strengths to the forefront.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>Part 3. Meeting Ray</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>I met Ray Deck, an acclaimed expert mentor in low-code, no-code, and AI. Ray brought decades of experience in creating meaningful software and mentoring successful technologists. Together, we developed a unique methodology centered around leveraging LCNC for short iterations, co-creation, and empowering the business users.<br><br>With Ray&#x27;s insights and expertise, we have refined this transformation service, leveraging the boilerplate to provide clients with a head start, and enterprise training to further accelerate their development process.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>Part 4. Our Offering</strong></p>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>With this combined approach, the transformation is powerful. We work with a select group of business owners and founders each quarter who are committed to rapidly evolving their business with low-code/no-code technology. Our program is tailored to provide the strategy, implementation, training, and foundational boilerplates to make them self-sufficient in managing their software solutions for the long term.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>Contacting Me</strong></p>
